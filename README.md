# Automated Excel Sheet Processing
This project automates the processing of Excel sheets using the openpyxl Python package. It allows you to make any changes to the entire XLSX file in a matter of seconds.

Installation
To install this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install openpyxl
Usage
To use this project, simply call the process_excel_file() function with the filename of the Excel sheet you want to process. For example, to process a file named data.xlsx, you would call the function as follows:
